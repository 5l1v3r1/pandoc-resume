# Pandoc Résumé

This is a pandoc template for building a résumé.
Pandoc can convert `resume.md` into a PDF, a DOCX, and an HTML file with similar styles.

## Usage

Edit `resume.md` to add content. Edit `style.css` to change the HTML style and `reference.docx` for the DOCX style.

Run one of these commands to generate output:

```
build.sh pdf
build.sh docx
build.sh html
```

Run `all.sh` to generate all outputs.
You can also convert the DOCX into a PDF.
